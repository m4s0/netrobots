**name** | **String** |  | 
**token** | **String** | A unique token, that changes after a command is sent from a robot to the server.\nIt is used for recognizing a robot, and chaining the commands, because a robot can not issue another command, before it receive an answer from the server, with the next token to use.\n |

**realTimeTick** | **Number** | The time in seconds, the system waits before processing the next request from remote robots.\nWith slow nework connections this value should be higher, because otherwise some remote robots could miss some game turns.\nNOTE: this is the real world time you have for sending the next command without loosing a turn.\nNOTE: this time differs from timeIncrement, because timeIncrement is the simulation time that pass between two robots commands.\n |
