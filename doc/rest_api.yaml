## Type Definitions
##
## DEV-NOTE: Swagger in this version does not support synonyms types,
## so in case of types with only one property like Distance, Token, Speed, etc.. the type description was repeated in different places,
## for favouring elegant API usage respect elegant API definition.

          The bullet can make a limited damage if it explodes near the target.
          The limited damage decrease linearly from 50% to 0%, from 2 meters to 45 meters distance from the target.
          When you configure a robot, there is an associated a strenght using an heuristic, based on robot configured characteristics.
          Then the bulletDamage is increased until it does not reach the maximum possibile value.
